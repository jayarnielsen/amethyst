# Welcome to Amethyst

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a brilliant, lightweight alternative to heavyweight content management systems like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). Its developer oriented approach is refreshing in a sea of dumbed-down graphical page builders. I could gush about the superiority of Jekyll all day, but it isn't without its shortcomings. Besides a built in local server, Jekyll doesn't offer much in the way of modern development tools. Not that it needs to have these features built in; that's what starter themes are for! Like the magnificent WordPress theme, [Sage 9](https://roots.io/sage), which offers such features as Webpack asset management, ES6 support, and Browsersync for synchronized browser testing. Oh my!

## Look at it shine

Amethyst has all kinds of bells and whistles packed in. Perhaps more importantly: it's designed to be easy to use and modify. Out of the box, Amethyst includes...

- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) for stylesheets
- ES6 for JavaScript
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) for compiling assets, optimizing images, and concatenating and minifying CSS and JavaScript files
- [Jekyll Compress HTML](http://jch.penibelst.de/) for HTML minification
- [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/) for synchronized browser testing
- [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites) CSS framework (with support for Bootstrap if that's your thing)

Plus all the benefits of Jekyll including markdown support, liquid templates, and blog-aware features. [This very site](http://jayarnielsen.com) was built on Amethyst! You can even [view the source code](https://github.com/jayarnielsen/jayarnielsen) on Gitub.

Because hosting is spendy and obnoxious, Amethyst is also set up to make it extra simple to deploy to Github Pages for free, no strings attached hosting.
