Its developer oriented approach is refreshing in a sea of dumbed-down graphical page builders. I could gush about the superiority of Jekyll all day, but it isn’t without its shortcomings. Besides a built in local server, Jekyll doesn’t offer much in the way of modern development tools. Not that it needs to have these features built in; that’s what starter themes are for! Like the magnificent WordPress theme, <a href="https://roots.io/sage">Sage 9</a>, which offers such features as Webpack asset management, ES6 support, and Browsersync for synchronized browser testing. Oh my!</p> <p>As I’ve become more comfortable with Sage 9, my Jekyll workflow has been left feeling antiquated and kludgy. Amethyst was born out of a desire to modernize the development process for Jekyll-based websites, and is heavily inspired by Sage 9.</p> <h2 id="opposite-and-complimentary">Opposite and Complimentary</h2> <p>Unlike Sage 9, which builds upon a dynamic, living foundation (WordPress), Amethyst is static. Solid like a rock (or like Jekyll). Sage and Amethyst are also, conveniently, opposite colors.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/amethyst.jpg" alt="Sage != Amethyst" /></p> <p>Where WordPress prides itself on simplicity for the technically challenged, Jekyll thrives as a tool for the technically abled. The platforms are yin and yang in the development toolkit, and Amethyst exists to bridge the development workflow gap between the two.</p> <h2 id="look-at-it-shine">Look at it shine</h2> <p>Amethyst has all kinds of bells and whistles packed in. Perhaps more importantly: it’s designed to be easy to use and modify. Out of the box, Amethyst includes…</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> for stylesheets</li> <li>ES6 for JavaScript</li> <li><a href="https://webpack.github.io">Webpack</a> for compiling assets, optimizing images, and concatenating and minifying CSS and JavaScript files</li> <li><a href="http://jch.penibelst.de/">Jekyll Compress HTML</a> for HTML minification</li> <li><a href="http://www.browsersync.io/">Browsersync</a> for synchronized browser testing</li> <li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites">Foundation 6</a> CSS framework (with support for Bootstrap if that’s your thing)</li> </ul> <p>Plus all the benefits of Jekyll including markdown support, liquid templates, and blog-aware features.</p> <p>Because hosting is spendy and obnoxious, Amethyst is also set up to make it extra simple to deploy to Github Pages for free, no strings attached hosting.</p> <h2 id="k-thnx-bai">K THNX BAI!</h2> <p>Amethyst was developed by me over the course of several, moderately painful weeks. It’s primarily a labor of curiosity. This seemingly simple theme was no small feat to piece together. Which is why I’ll be soon to follow up with a comprehensive tutorial series outlining not only how to use Amethyst, but why each component exists and what its purpose is.</p> <div class="grid-x grid-padding-y align-center"> <div class="cell shrink"> <a class="button large" href="https://github.com/jayarnielsen/amethyst">Download Amethyst</a> <a class="button large" href="https://github.com/jayarnielsen/amethyst/wiki">Learn Amethyst</a> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <script src="/assets/app.js"></script> </body> </html>
